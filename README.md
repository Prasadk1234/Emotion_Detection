## Description

- Addressed class imbalance in the FER-2013 dataset by employing image augmentation and class weights, improving model robustness 
- Designed and iterated on custom CNN models, including advanced architectures such as VGG16 and ResNet50v2, to optimize performance 
- Achieved a 66% overall accuracy on emotion classification, with the final model based on ResNet50v2, detailed through to precision, recall and F1-scores across 7 emotion labels.
- Deployed the model for real-time emotion  detection in live video streams using Gradio and OpenCV, showcasing emotion labels dynamically on-screen
- Authored a comprehensive blog detailing the projectâ€™s approach, challenges, and resolutions, and shared the source code on Github for community engagement
